CSD-MD is a Python package that enables the user to setup and run a molecular
dynamics simulation from an entry in the Cambridge Structural Database.

Installation:

Note, CSD System must first be installed:
https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/support-and-resources/csdsdownloads/

Quicker, easier and more robust using mamba instead of conda:
Mamba installation instructions: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh ---> yes to initialise at the end (add executables to the path)

Example environment setup:
mamba create -n ccdc python=3.9
mamba activate ccdc
mamba install openmm openmmforcefields pyyaml tensorflow=2.12.0 biopython
python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://pip.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/ csd-python-api

Notes:
 Problems finding the CSD Database so had to follow instructions here to set
 up mamba and save environment variables in ./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh:
 https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#set-env-vars

Running MD simulations:

A single .yaml input file is required. This contains all information
required to retrieve a structure from CSD and run an MD simulation.

For a ligand simulation openmmforcefields is used to generate a
non-standard residue template with AM1-BCC charges assigned.

Example usage:
"python CSD-MD.py --md_params input.yaml > md.log"

Example .yaml input file (input.yaml by default):

    name: demonstration
    system type: ligand
    CSD identifier: ACSALA
    PDB identifier: 3I40
    pair-net model: none
    solvate system: yes
    simulation type: standard
    simulation time (ns): 0.01
    timestep (fs): 1.0
    temperature (K): 300.0
    ensemble: NVT

Input options:

    name:                   name of the simulation

    system type:            "ligand", "protein" or "protein-ligand"

    CSD identifier:         identifier associated with CSD ligand entry

    PDB identifier:         identifier associated with PDB protein entry

    pair-net model:         name of trained pair-net model to search for in
                            "pair-net_models" directory. "None" will default
                            to Amber potential. More MM potentials to be added

    solvate system:         "yes" will fill box with explicit waters, modelled
                            by default using TIP3P

    simulation type:        "standard" is the only option for now

    simulation time (ns):   total simulation time in ns

    timestep (fs):          integration timestep in femtoseconds

    temperature (K):        temperature in Kelvin

    ensemble:               "NVT"
